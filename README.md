# c_test_I
C programming language test made by codility.com service. Task to do is:

Write a function:

                      int solution(int A[], int N)
                      
   that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer that does not occur in A.
   For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5,
                given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4,
                given A = [-2, -3], the function should return 1.
   Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

           - N is an integer within the range [1...100,000]
           - each element of an array A is an integer within the range [-1,000,000...1,000,000]
